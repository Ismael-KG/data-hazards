```{admonition} Why are the Hazard Labels so scary-looking?
We know that the [Data Hazards labels](site/contents/materials/workshop/data-hazards) are a bit frightening. Argh! There is a picture of a skull!
Please know that __we don't want these labels to scare anyone away from considering ethics or from doing data science__, and we will do everything that we can to make applying Data Hazards labels as welcoming and approachable as possible, but also have some good reasons for choosing these images.
   
We chose this format because of the similarity to [COSHH hazard labels](https://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/hazard-symbols-hazard-pictograms.htm) - hazard labels for chemicals.
We made this choice because we want a similar response from people:
1. Attention-grabbing, asking people to stop and think, and take the safety precautions seriously, rather than as an optional extra.
2. We're people to "handle with care": not to stop doing the work; we still use chemicals, but we think about how it can be done safely and how to avoid emergencies.
3. They are familiar, especially to scientists, who (within universities) tend to have the least experience of applying ethics.

```

Data Hazards is a project about worst-case scenarios of Data Science. 
Data Scientists are great at selling our work, for example communicating the gains in efficiency and accuracy, but we are less well-practiced in thinking about the ethical implications of our work. 
The ethical implications go beyond most ethics Institutional Review Boards, to questions about the wider societal impact of Data Science and algorithms work.

We aim to create resources which:
1. Make ethical and future-thinking more accessible to data scientists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians - to apply to their own work.
2. Enable bringing together and respecting diverse and interdisciplinary viewpoints to this work, through workshops or mailing lists.
3. Include a shared vocabulary of Data Hazards in the form of [Data Hazard Labels](contents/materials/workshop/data-hazards), which help us to talk about these risks together.
