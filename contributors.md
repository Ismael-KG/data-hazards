# Record of Contributions

The Data Hazards project exists because of the support and contributions of many different people. 
This page is a place where anyone who has contributed to the project can be recognised for the time, effort and expertise they have given to Data Hazards. 

This page is based on a similar model used by [The Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) for recognising contributors to open source projects. 

We welcome anyone asking to be added to this page if they have made a contribution.

> In September 2021, I was delighted to facilitate a workshop alongside [@NatalieThurlby](https://github.com/NatalieThurlby) and [@ninadicara](https://github.com/ninadicara) to [test the Data Hazard labels](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/events/2021/data-hazards-workshop---21-september-2021.html) with researchers from diverse backgrounds. This meant working with Natalie and Nina to familiarise myself with [the prompts they had prepared](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-hazards/blob/ae2ecfad7f85fe48670ed6221a6563353d31e77b/images/worst-case-prompt.png), and then keeping the conversation flowing during breakout rooms with workshop participants. I had previously gathered feedback from The Alan Turing Institute's [Ethics Advisory Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/data-ethics/ethics-advisory-group) (EAG) for the Data Hazard labels. My time with the Turing's EAG allowed me to appreciate the value of the Data Hazard labels, both in the context of training data scientists on questions of ethics, and for preparing documentation for the review of research ethics committees.
