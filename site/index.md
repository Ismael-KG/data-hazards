Data Hazards is a project about worst-case scenarios of Data Science. 
Data Scientists are great at selling our work, for example communicating the gains in efficiency and accuracy, but we are less well-practiced in thinking about the ethical implications of our work. 
The ethical implications go beyond most ethics Institutional Review Boards, to questions about the wider societal impact of Data Science and algorithms work.

We aim to create resources which:
1. Make ethical and future-thinking more accessible to data scientists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians - to apply to their own work.
2. Enable bringing together and respecting diverse and interdisciplinary viewpoints to this work, through workshops or mailing lists.
3. Include a shared vocabulary of Data Hazards in the form of [Data Hazard Labels](contents/materials/workshop/data-hazards), which help us to talk about these risks together.
