# Workshop timings

We use the following timings for the Data Hazard workshop, it lasts between 90 minutes and 2 hours.
The workshops use a version of a technique from social work known as ['The Reflective Team'](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-15877-8_324-1).
This is designed to help ensure that both the audience and the project owner get an opportunity to speak and listen.
